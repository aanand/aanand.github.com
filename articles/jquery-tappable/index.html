    <h2 class="title">Better Tap Behaviour with jquery.tappable.js</h2><div class='summary'><p>The behaviour of tappable elements in Mobile Safari is unacceptably ugly. Unfortunately, taking control of it is more involved than it perhaps ought to be. <a href='https://github.com/aanand/jquery.tappable.js'>jquery.tappable.js</a> does (most of) the hard work for you.</p></div><hr class='summary-break'/><p>I hope we can all agree that <a href="http://cvil.ly/2011/06/19/pretenders-why-mobile-web-apps-should-stop-trying-to-act-like-native-apps/">mobile web apps shouldn’t pretend to be native apps</a>, but I don’t like the thought of having to accept the current state of most mobile apps as the hand we’ve been dealt. The whole business feels somewhat 2000-era, which is frankly weird—we’ve spent a good decade improving the look and feel of apps in the browser, but the majority of mobile web apps seem content with a half-hearted grey-boxes-and-lines style and a rigid, transitionless interactivity.</p>

<p>Does the responsibility lie with the vendors of mobile browsers? Partially. Apple are only now getting round to adding <a href="http://cubiq.org/ios5-the-first-true-web-app-ready-platform">native support for scrollable elements</a>: so far, we’ve been stuck with a range of lovingly crafted fakeries that range from ‘pathetic’ to ‘uncanny valley’. The problem goes beyond the slow pace of change, though—even when the functionality required to implement higher-quality interaction <em>is</em> in place, it’s often in such a way as to leave an inordinate amount of work to the app developer. A perfect example of this is the default behaviour of ‘clickable’ (or, rather, <em>tappable</em>) elements in Mobile Safari.</p>

<p>Tap a link, a button or indeed any element with a <code>click</code> event defined, and two unpleasant things happen. First, <em>nothing</em>, for around 300 milliseconds. Then, an ugly dark-grey overlay—you know the one I’m talking about. Compared to the responsiveness of tappable UI elements in native apps, using a mobile app where every element behaves this way feels like operating your iPhone with someone else’s finger.</p>

<p>In developing <a href="http://nnnnext.com">nnnnext</a>, I quickly came to the decision that this wasn’t good enough, and set about trying to fix it. While <a href="http://css-infos.net/property/-webkit-tap-highlight-color">removing the overlay</a> was easy enough, it quickly became obvious that iOS’ touch behaviour is more complicated than I intitially suspected, primarily in that <em>it treats a “long tap” differently from a “short tap”</em>.</p>

<p>Perform a short tap (i.e. literally just <em>tap</em> the screen), and the element is immediately highlighted and the appropriate action executed. Perform a long tap (keeping your finger down for a moment), and the element is highlighted after a short delay (around 150ms) and the action executed when you lift your finger—unless you move your finger first, in which case the highlight is immediately removed and the action cancelled.</p>

<p>The reason for the long-tap highlight delay became apparent after I’d coded my initial implementation: if the element is immediately highlighted when you put your finger down, then every time you scroll you’ll get a flash-of-highlight if you happen to start your scroll by putting your finger on that element. This is, I believe, why the delay is only in place on large, column-spanning elements of the type you can’t avoid touching when you scroll, while buttons and other small widgets react the moment you touch them.</p>

<p>I realised some of this only after implementing an incorrect solution, releasing it and blogging my ignorance. Another fact I overlooked is that Mobile Safari’s behaviour <em>only</em> deviates from the rest of the OS on short taps. Long-tap behaviour is the same, but with short taps, both highlighting <em>and</em> action are delayed, and for around twice as long as the long-tap highlight delay! The reason for this (though I failed to perceive this blindingly obvious fact at the time) is Safari’s <em>double-tap-to-zoom feature</em>—if there were no delay, or if it were much shorter, double-tapping would be impossible.</p>

<p>In most mobile-optimised web apps, however, zooming isn’t even enabled, rendering any short-tap delay worse than useless. Here, then, is our desired behaviour, expressed in terms of browser events:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Event order</th>
<th>Desired effect</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">touchstart, timeout, touchend</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Highlight on timeout, fire callback on touchend (long tap)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">touchstart, touchend, timeout</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Highlight and fire callback on touchend (short tap)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">touchstart, timeout, touchmove, touchend</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Highlight, then de-highlight on touchmove (long tap cancelled by scrolling)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">touchstart, touchmove, timeout, touchend</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">None (scroll)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">touchstart, touchmove, touchend, timeout</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">None (scroll)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>I promised up there in the first paragraph that I’d done the hard work for you, and here you go: <a href="https://github.com/aanand/jquery.tappable.js">jquery.tappable.js</a> implements this behaviour, and falls back to <code>click</code> events in desktop browsers for good measure.</p>

<p>It deviates from the above table in one respect, however—the highlight class is removed (or, in the case of a short tap, not added) before firing the callback. This is a matter of code aesthetics for me: I don’t want a library or plugin I’m using to add a transient class to an element without cleaning up after itself. When I need the highlight class to stick around longer (which in the nnnnext codebase is the exception, not the rule), I add it again in the callback function.</p>

<p>Anyway, examples:</p>
