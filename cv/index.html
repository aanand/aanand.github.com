            I’ve been a professional software developer since 2005. I do it all:

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Here’s what I’ve been up to lately:
          </p>
          <h2>
            Orchard, Fig and Docker
          </h2>
          <p>
            In 2013, I co-founded <a href="https://www.orchardup.com">Orchard</a> with <a href="https://fir.sh/">Ben Firshman</a>. Among other things, we built a container orchestrator and development environment manager called <a href="http://www.fig.sh/">Fig</a>, which quickly became the most popular tool of its kind. We were acquired by Docker in 2014, Fig became <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/">Docker Compose</a>, and I became its lead developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compose has been a huge success, and is used by too many teams and companies to count. Among its best-known users are HP, IBM, PayPal, The Washington Post and Expedia. In addition, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cmd-ecs-cli-compose.html">Amazon AWS</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-docker-compose">Microsoft Azure</a> both have built-in support for the Compose file format, and it’s part of <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/local-development-with-docker-compose">Heroku’s official development workflow</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Docker, I oversaw Compose’s improvement and evolution as a fundamental component of Docker’s tooling. I spread the word, presenting it at DockerCon keynote sessions and industry conferences. The last project I worked on was integrating its file format and functionality <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/stack-deploy/">into the Docker Engine itself</a>, further enabling its use for deploying large-scale, production-ready applications.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Other professional work
          </h2>
          <p>
            That describes my day job for the last few years. Before that, it was largely a ton of contract work on web and iOS apps – too many to list, but some highlights:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I was the initial developer on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/18/5817838/paperlater-read-it-later-newspaper">service by Newspaper Club</a> to deliver custom-printed newspapers of saved articles from the web, using an Instapaper-style bookmarklet and formatting pages with a purpose-built layout engine.
            </li>
            <li>
              I worked on many and various projects for the dearly-departed <a href="https://www.thisismyjam.com/">This Is My Jam</a>, including prototype iOS apps.
            </li>
          </ul>
