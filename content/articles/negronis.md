summary: I was out last Friday at a bar where they had a "Negroni Tic-Tac-Toe" offer---you could custom-build your drink from a selection of 3 gins, 3 vermouths and 3 amari, and if you got "3 in a row" you'd get &pound;5 off your bill. It's a laughably stingy deal, but it got me thinking. About functional programming, I mean.
