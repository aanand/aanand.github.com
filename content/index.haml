    I’m a programmer and this is my website and I hope that you like it. Here are the articles that are on this site which I have written using my fingers:

  .index
    - sorted_articles.each do |item|
      .article
        .metadata
          .created= time_tag(item)

        %a.title{ :href => item.path }= item[:title]

        = maruku(item[:summary])
